# Analytics::Pros::Blog::Scrape

I've built a Command Line Interface (or CLI) where I'm scraping the Analytics Pros blog, one of my favorite places to read and learn about advanced digital analytics. Once you run the program, you'll instantly get a list of their blog categories. You can then type a number to get a copy/pastable URL that you can then paste on your preferred browser. 

Nothing fancy, just a cool scraping exercise.

## Installation

Clone the repo below to your machine:
git@github.com:lpzraf/analytics-pros-blog-scrape.git

Move to the right directory performing the command below:
cd analytics-pros-blog-scrape

Type:
./bin/blog-scrape

...and thats it! 

Follow the program instructions and discover a bunch of insightful articles from one of the best analytics people out there.
